"NEWS SUMMARY     U.S. Envoy Presses Iraqis To Finish a Constitution  The new American ambassador to Iraq waded into the debate over its constitution, signaling that the United States would work to guarantee the rights of Iraqi women and to blunt the desires of ethnic and religious factions pushing for broader autonomy in the new Iraqi state. A1    Evaluation of Palestinian Forces  The first independent survey of the Palestinian security environment since the death of Yasir Arafat found that the security forces of the Palestinian Authority were unfit, and said that more attention must be paid to building up institutions. A1    More Details on Egypt Attacks  Egyptian officials said that all three explosions were suicide bombings and suggested that police checkpoints may have forced two of the bombers to set off their explosives early, before reaching targets packed with Western tourists. A3    U.S. and North Korea Hold Talks  Negotiators from the United States and North Korea held a rare, private meeting, underscoring the heightened stakes and grave concerns surrounding the six-nation talks on the North Korean nuclear crisis scheduled to open Thursday. A3    2 Suspects Identified in Britain  The British police identified by name two of four men suspected of trying to set off bombs on the London transport network last week and said the bombers used a Tupperware-like container -- known as Delta 6250 -- to build the devices. A6    Two experienced militants, both veterans of the war in Afghanistan, told an independent Pakistani journalist that they had met one of the July 7 London bombing suspects, Shehzad Tanweer, on a trip to a known militant training camp north of the capital, Islamabad. A6    Arroyo Seeks Change in System  President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo of the Philippines, facing demands for her resignation, called for the adoption of a parliamentary form of government to replace the current system. A9    Pope's Prayer Omits Israel  Israel and the Vatican traded sharp words over a Sunday sermon in which the new pope, Benedict XVI, prayed that God would stop the ''murderous hand'' of terrorists who had struck in ''Egypt, Turkey, Iraq, Great Britain.'' A9    ARTS E1-10    Floating Museum Reopens  The Waterfront Museum and Showboat Barge in Brooklyn, closed for the last two years for repairs to its hull, has reopened at a newly refurbished pier a few hundred feet from its longtime home. E1    Philharmonic Denies Bias  The New York Philharmonic angrily denied charges by a male violinist that a bias in favor of women caused his ouster from the orchestra. Unspecified behavior problems were the reason, a spokesman said. E3    NATIONAL A10-15    Administration to Release Some Nominee Records  The Bush administration plans to release documents from Judge John G. Roberts's tenure in the White House counsel's office and his earlier job working for the attorney general, but will not make public papers covering the four years he spent as principal deputy solicitor general. A1    Veto on Morning-After Pill  Confronting one of the most controversial issues to cross his desk, Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts vetoed a bill that would expand access to the morning-after pill, saying he believed it sometimes functioned as ''an abortion pill,'' not just a contraceptive pill. A10    U.S. Soldier Admits Guilt  A soldier accused of shooting an Iraqi police officer to death and then shooting himself to support a claim of self-defense pleaded guilty on the day his court-martial was to begin, and now faces a prison term. A10    Democrats Question Security  In the wake of terrorist attacks abroad, a procession of potential Democratic presidential candidates raised sharp questions about the Republican leadership's handling of national security. A11    Shuttle Liftoff Hangs on Sensor  Counting down to a planned liftoff, NASA officials said that two familiar obstacles remained in the way of the first space shuttle mission in two and a half years: a persistent fuel sensor problem and the fast-changing Florida weather. A14    NEW YORK/REGION B1-6         Bag Inspection Expanded For Suburban Commuters  Hundreds of suburban commuters, from central New Jersey to Rockland County, N.Y., were asked for the first time to submit their bags for inspection by the police, as two major transit carriers in the region joined New York City authorities trying to buffer their train, subway and bus systems against a terror attack. B1    A Close Call Recalled  The captain of a DC-8 cargo jet that nearly missed hitting a Boeing 767 that had blundered onto a runway at Kennedy Airport gave his first public account of the dramatic seconds when the two planes nearly collided. B1    Rich Democrats Back Mayor  Prominent Democratic donors are sending chills through local party leaders by publicly supporting the Republican mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, this campaign year.

"INSIDE   Counting down to the liftoff of the space shuttle Discovery at 10:39 this morning, Bud Mann of Altoona, Fla., cooled off near Cape Canaveral. NASA says that risk of catastrophic failure is about 1 in 100, more than twice as great as an estimate issued before the loss of the Columbia in 2003. NASA put the chance of acceptable weather at 60 percent.   PAGE A14    2 Suspects Named in London  The British police have identified two of the four men suspected of trying to set off bombs last Thursday in London's transportation system. They also said the men used a type of plastic container for their devices that is sold in a number of stores in Britain.  PAGE A6    A Big Change in Boot Camp  Years ago, drill sergeants accused of abusing recruits might have been only reprimanded or transferred. That is no longer true. Just ask Staff Sgt. Michael G. Rhoades.  PAGE A12    Remaking a Face  After years of heated scientific debate over ethics and technical feasibility, the Cleveland Clinic has become the first medical institution to approve a face transplant. A team led by Dr. Maria Siemionow is seeking a patient to undergo the startling medical procedure.  SCIENCE TIMES, PAGE F1     Details on Bombings in Egypt  Egyptian officials, in the first detailed account of Saturday's terrorist attack at a resort on Egypt's Red Sea coast, said that the three explosions had been set off by suicide bombers and that police checkpoints might have forced two of the bombers to set off their explosives early, before reaching targets packed with Western tourists.  PAGE A3     Record Tower For Chicago  The Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava has designed what would be the country's tallest building, in Chicago. It would be 115 stories, topping out at 1,458 feet, with a spire that would reach about 2,000 feet. The developer, Christopher T. Carley, plans to announce the $500 million project today.  PAGE A13    Creating A Folk Hero  Millions of people have seen the frescoes of Constantino Brumidi, the Italian-born artist whose work decorates the United States Capitol. But most people don't know his name. It's one man's mission to restore luster and honors to Brumidi and, perhaps, make him an American folk hero.  PAGE E1",2005-07-26,article,Summary,,[]
