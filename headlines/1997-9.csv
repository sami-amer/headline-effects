"COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT         n    By FRANK LITSKY       TODAY'S KEY GAMES    No. 4 WASHINGTON 0-0  No. 19 at BRIGHAM YOUNG 0-0    Brigham Young's only loss last year was to Washington. This time, Washington has a top quarterback in Brook Huard and a tough defense to stop Paul Shoemaker, Brigham Young's new quarterback.       No. 5 FLORIDA STATE  0-0  No. 23 at SOUTHERN CAL 0-0    Flordia State has too much experience and Southern California too far to come. As Coach John Robinson of the Trojans said, ''Our weapons could be pretty sharp by midseason.'' But not yet.   TV: ABC, 8:00 P.M.    No. 24 COLORADO STATE  1-0  No. 8  at COLORADO  0-0    Their first meeting when both are ranked. Colorado's veteran offense replaces Koy Detmer, a 3,000-yard passer last year, with John Hessler, a 2,000-yard passer in 1995.    No. 3  TENNESSEE  1-0      at U.C.L.A. 0-1    A passing battle between Peyton Manning of Tennessee (310 yards and three touchdowns against Washington State).  TV: ABC, 3:30 P.M.    OTHER GAMES    EAST    East Carolina (0-0)  at West Virginia (1-0)  Two strong running games. Amos Zereoue of West Virginia rushed for 174 yards last week, Scott Harley of East Carolina for 1,745 yards last season.  TV: ESPN, 12:30 P.M.    Marshall (0-1)  at Army (0-0)  Army returns only four starters on offense and one on defense. Marshall has an explosive receiver in 6-5 Randy Moss.    Boston College (0-0)  at Temple (0-1)  While other teams ease into the season against nonconference foes, Boston College starts with three Big East games.  TV: ABC, Noon    SOUTH    Indiana (0-0)  at No. 7 North Carolina (0-0)  North Carolina's sound offense and top defense should breeze over a team picked for last in the Big Ten.   TV: ESPN2, Noon    No. 21 Northwestern (1-0)  at Wake Forest (0-0)  Northwestern should be comfortable despite losing its best receiver, D'Wayne Bates, with a broken leg.    North Carolina State (1-0)  at Duke (0-0)  In upsetting Syracuse in overtime, State's Jamie Barnette passed for 279 yards plus the deciding 2-point conversion.    Southern Methodist (0-0)  at Mississippi (1-0)  Ole Miss fell a yard short of losing to Central Florida last week.    Kentucky (1-0)  at Mississippi State (1-0)  State must stop Tim Couch, who passed for 398 yards and four touchdowns against Louisville.    MIDWEST    Georgia Tech (0-0)  at No. 11 Notre Dame (0-0)  Bob Davie, Notre Dame's new coach, fears that his defensive front seven is too green. Not to worry.  TV: NBC, 2:30 P.M.    No. 21 Kansas State (0-0)  at Northern Illinois (0-1)  Kansas State should roll behind quarterback Michael Bishop, a junior-college transfer.    Wester Michigan (1-0)  at No. 25 Michigan State (0-0)  State has a good running game and a good defensive line, but little depth up front on offense or defense.    Texas Christian (0-0)  at Kansas (1-0)  The Kansas defense had two interceptions for touchdowns against Alabama-Birmingham.    SOUTHWEST    Syracuse (1-1)  at Oklahoma (0-1)  Coach Paul Pasqualoni is unsure how Syracuse will respond after that dreary loss to North Carolina State. As he said, ''Football, like life, is about 10 percent what happens and 90 percent how you react to it.''    Air Force (1-0)  at Rice (0-0)  Air Force beat Idaho on a late stop. Rice will be tougher.    MISMATCHES    Pittsburgh (1-0)  at No. 1 Penn State (1-0)  Pittsburgh won't share tapes of last week's victory against Southwestern Louisiana. It will make no difference.  TV: PPV, 3:30 P.M.    Central Michigan (1-0)  at No. 2 Florida (1-0)  Coach Steve Spurrier calls his Flordia team ''just a common, average, bottom-of-the-league bunch of guys right now.'' Not really.    Texas, El Paso (0-0)  at No. 10 Louisiana St. (0-0)  In last year's opener, Louisana State beat underdog Houston by a point. This time, the Tigers are five-touchdown favorites.    Rutgers (0-1)  at No. 12 Texas (0-0)  After a 59-19 beating by Virginia last week, linebacker Aaron Brady of Rutgers said, ''It's very discouraging. I felt a little bit of shame.''
