"Tradegy at Sea         n    By Suzanne O'Connor     SEA TALES: INFERNO ON THE MORRO CASTLE looks at the tragedy as an unsolved mystery, with re-enactments, archival film and survivor interviews. The luxury liner burst into explosive flames in 1934, on her 174th cruise between Havana and New York, killing 134 people. Was this an accident or a madman's plot? The narrator Patrick Tull relates the intrigues of that night: a captain found dead in his stateroom; a radioman intitially hailed as a hero who ended his life in prison (for arson); an acting captain who failed to sound the general alarm or order an SOS call. The Morro Castle washed ashore off Asbury Park, N.J., where she lay for three months before being sold as scrap. - THURS. at 9 P.M. and 1 A.M. on A&E.       Photo.

"Hip-Hopping Onto the Late-Night Scene         n    BY LISA W. FODERARO     FOR more than three years, television executives have bemoaned the void left by Arsenio Hall, the first successful black host of a late-night talk show. They have waited patiently for someone who had the power to enthrall young African-American viewers while crossing over to a wider audience, someone capable of delivering a high-energy show that would make the two reigning princes of late night, Jay Leno and David Letterman, look downright dowdy.              Well, they may have found him, in stereo.     Earlier this month, on the same night, at the same time (11 in New York City), Keenen Ivory Wayans and Chris Spencer, both Black comedians with neat goatees and neon smiles, made their debuts from Los Angeles. In a droll nod to their syndication showdown, Mr. Spencer, whose show, ''Vibe,'' is seen in New York City on WWOR, Channel 9, pulled out a congratulatory fruit basket sent him by Mr. Wayans. As he began his monologue, chomping on a plum, he collapsed as though poisoned.     There is another new show in the wings with the potential to draw a young, multiracial audience. The basketball legend Earvin (Magic) Johnson is now taping pilots for a late-night talk show he is developing with Twenthieth Television, the syndication division of Fox Studios. Called ''The Magic Hour,'' it is scheduled to begin early next year, ideally after either Mr. Wayans or Mr. Spencer has called it a night, those involved in the production whisper.     Of the two new hosts already on the air, 39-year-old Mr. Wayans, whose show is on WNYW, Channel 5, in New York, has the edge in terms of name recognition. He was the creator and star of the Emmy Award-winning comedy series ''In Living Color'' and has also had success in films, as a star of ''Hollywood Shuffle'' and as writer, director and star of ''A Low Down Dirty Shame.''     The set of his new show is a pastiche of shape and color: no desk, just a couple of modernist couches, a coffee table resembling a giant peanut and a sprawling fish tank that glows lavender. Mr. Wayans's sartorial tastes range from Flashy to bizarre. One night he sported a shiny black jumpsuit, another night a slinky chartreuse shirt, all topped off with clunky jewelry.     Despite the trappings, Mr. Wayans has an easy way about him. He seemed preternaturally calm on opening night in contrast to one of his guests, the actor Brendan Fraser, who nearly gulped with nervousness. And Mr. Wayans loves to coax his guests into talking about sex. Pamela Anderson Lee, the former star of ''Baywatch,'' volunteered that her libido knew no bounds now that she was pregnant.     ''Has pregnancy slowed you down?'' Mr. Wayans asked.     ''Your sex drive is through the roof,'' she exclaimed. ''There are no sharp corners on any of the furniture at home.''     Then there are the off-the-wall comedy sketches and mock commercials. A public-service announcement with the message ''Smoke: because holes in throats are pretty cool'' showed a nicotine-addicted grandmother blowing out birthday candles and playing a saxophone through her neck. Another, a takeoff on commercials for exercise contraptions, advertised the ''Sexerciser'' for $29.95, with vigorous demonstrations.     ''Keenen has a big following that loves and adores him, which is a great help,'' said Charlie Parsons, a British television producer who is collaborating on the show as an executive producer with Mr. Wayans and Eric L. Gold. '' 'In Living Color' was universal in its comedic appeal. This new show has a generational appeal. The target audience is younger and hipper. Everyone is welcome.''     Mr. Parsons said that while Mr. Leno's and Mr. Letterman's shows were ''incredibly well produced,'' he believed there was ''definitely an audience that isn't being serviced by them.''     The star of ''Vibe,'' 29-year-old Mr. Spencer, is after the same audience. ''We're just trying to add some flavor to the milk,'' he said in an interview. Many viewers ''left the whole late-night arena after Arsenio,'' he added. ''There are a bunch of artists who don't get the opportunities because of the style of music they play or the kinds of jokes they tell.''     While Mr. Spencer may not have a household name, the creator of his show, Quincy Jones, does. A musician, composer, and record and film producer who has won 26 Grammy Awards, Mr. Jones has styled the show on his three-year-old magazine, ''Vibe.''     His connections have given the scenes and on the screen. An executive producer, Daniel Kellison, helped start ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' and before that spent eight years with Mr. Letterman. The director, Sandra Fullerton, held the same job with Mr. Hall from 1989 to 1994.     Mr. Jones appeared for 10 minutes at the start of the first show before handing it over to Mr. Spencer. in those few minutes, he schmoozed with President Clinton about America's youth in an appearance taped at the White House. Then Mr. Jones told viewers, ''No matter what your age or race or sex, 'Vibe,' will be an equal opportunity entertainer.''     The guests that night included Whoopi Goldberg, Brandy, Anthony Edwards of ''E.R.,'' the female rap group Salt-n-Pepa and, by satellite, Denzel Washington and Spike Lee.     The choice of the relatively unknown Mr. Spencer is not as odd as it seems. He is, after all, young, handsome and very funny. ''How often is a brother given an opportunity to go into a million homes and not be arrested?'' he quipped upon first taking the stage.     A peripatetic stand-up comic, Mr. Spencer, who favors expensive-looking, trendy jackets, has appeared on MTV, ''In Living Color'' and Mr. Hall's show. He also has close ties to the Wayans family. He had a starring role in the film ''Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood,'' which Keenen Wayans produced. And in the publicity kit for ''Vibe,'' Mr. Spencer named Mr. Wayans's brother, Damon, the comedian and actor, as one of his role models, along with Jack Paar and Mohammed Ali.     Like ''The Keenan Ivory Wayans Show,'' ''Vibe'' strives for an integrated guest list. A recent show included the actress Demi Moore and the model Naomi Campbell. The studio audience is also integrated, roughly half white and half black. Only the musical guests seem one-dimensional, with the focus on rap and soul. But Mr. Spencer said he saw nothing wrong with that.     ''Hip-hop is now pop,'' he said. ''When you see Japanese kids getting their hair fried so it looks like an Afro and wearing pants falling off, that's not about acting black. That's about pop culture.''

"Curtain Up         n    By Howard Thompson     Though Hitchcock acknowledged that STAGE FRIGHT (1950) missed the target, it does score on backstage atmosphere. The main weakness is the meandering whodunit, as a veteran sleuth's daughter (Jane Wyman) endeavors to shield the main suspect, a handsome young actor (Richard Todd, above). At the center fo the case, a musical star (Marlene Dietrich) flutters flirtatiously. Ms. Wyman is natural as ever, Todd looks desperate and Dietrich adds gauzy allure. The fringe rewards include the veterans Alastair Sim and Sybil Thorndike as Ms. Wyman's parents. But the best performance comes from Kay Walsh in a cameo as a slatternly maid. - THURS. at 2 P.M. on AMC.          Photo: Richard Todd (Warner Brothers)",1997-08-31,article,News,,[]
