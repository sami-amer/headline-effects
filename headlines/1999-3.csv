"CLASSICAL MUSIC AND DANCE GUIDE  Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region.   Opera   ''AIDA,'' Metropolitan Opera. This is the 18th performance that Verdi's Egyptian opera has had since the opening of the season, so the horses must know their way across the stage by now. The cast includes several who return from the fall: Maria Guleghina, who was sweet and sure in the title role, Nina Terentieva as Amneris, and Robert Lloyd, a formidable Ramfis. Placido Domingo is also back, conducting, while his role of Radames is sung by Dennis O'Neill. Jeffrey Wells is the King and Alexandru Agache, new to the company, Amonasro. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $25 to $210; sold out, but returns may be available  (Paul Griffiths).",1999-03-26,article,Schedule,,[]

"POP AND JAZZ GUIDE  Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in New York City this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.   DAN BERN, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. Could Dan Bern be more obnoxious? He wails about the colossal size of his private anatomy, suggests that humanity originated with a sex act between aliens and monkeys, praises his female peers as ''chick singers'' and brings up uncomfortable subjects like racial separatism and the still mythical cure for AIDS. He earns the right to cause this trouble by being genuinely witty, often touching and just a heck of a fun guy to be around. His albums haven't yet totally captured the daring of his live performances, in which Mr. Bern lives up to the legacy of his idol, Lenny Bruce, by pushing himself and his audience in directions even he never expected. Tomorrow night at 7:30 and 10:30; tickets are $15 (Ann Powers).",1999-03-26,article,Schedule,,[]
