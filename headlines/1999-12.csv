"NEWS BRIEFS      INTERNATIONAL    SQN##825832##RUSSIA VOWS TO RETURN REFUGEES TO CHECHNYA  Russian officials said they would return the flood of refugees in the neighboring republic of Ingushetia to Russian-controlled areas of Chechnya by the end of the year.      SQN##824623##President Boris N. Yeltsin, bristling over President Clinton's criticism of Russia's military assault on Chechnya, complained that the United States was not treating Russia with the respect due a nuclear power.    SQN##820741##U.S. ORDERS RUSSIAN OUT  The United States said it was expelling a Russian diplomat who was found with eavesdropping equipment outside the State Department.    SQN##824593##CONTAINING SPREAD OF WEAPONS  The United States should raise financial support for programs intended to prevent former Soviet scientists from working for rogue states and terrorists seeking unconventional weapons, a research group said.    SQN##822736##REACTION TO ISRAEL-SYRIA TALKS  The news that Israel would hold peace talks with Syria galvanized Israeli opposition and government forces alike.      SQN##822299##The Syrian government and its Arab allies spoke with customary caution even as they welcomed the planned resumption of peace talks between Syria and Israel.    SQN##819190##U.S. OFFERS KOSOVO TOLL  The State Department estimated that 10,000 Kosovar Albanians were killed in the Serbian campaign this year to force out the Albanian population, a figure nearly five times larger than the number of bodies unearthed from mass graves.      SQN##819212##A Serbian court sentenced Flora Brovina, Kosovo's leading poet and a campaigner for women's rights, to 12 years in prison on charges of committing terrorism during the NATO air campaign in Kosovo.

SQN##819565##WIDENING ACCESS TO THE NET  President Clinton, executives of technology companies and representatives of minorities and civil rights groups announced plans to help bridge the ''digital divide'' between technology haves and have-nots, to make online access as common as telephone service.    SQN##825816##TALKING PHILANTHROPY  Nelson Mandela met with William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman, at Mr. Gates's Seattle-area estate.

SQN##825840##ONCE, A MARTIAN SEA  Scientists at Brown University said they had found tantalizing evidence that the northern lowlands of Mars once bore a wide ocean that had waves, hidden depths and long beaches. Although the findings do not bear directly on the issue of alien life, large amounts of water would be an indication that life might once have thrived on the planet.    SQN##821870##GOING COMMERCIAL IN SPACE  An American company that provides space services to NASA has reached an agreement that calls for a Russian company to build and place on the International Space Station a new segment that would be totally devoted to commercial projects.

A review of much of the evidence offers a more sharply defined picture of the incident than has previously come to light and underscores what are likely to be the critical issues at trial.    SQN##827037##PLANE CRASH IN NEW JERSEY  A plane carrying four people from Virginia crashed near Teterboro Airport. All four people aboard the plane were killed, officials said, and three people on the ground who came to their aid were injured.
