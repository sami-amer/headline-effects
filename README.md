# Understanding the Use of Inflammatory Headlines to Alter the Perception of an Article

## Abstract:
In this project, I used *New York Times* article and headline data from 2003 to draw conclusions about the objectivity and tone of headline/article pairs. Through various methods in Python and WebPPL, I show that there is a clear difference in the objectivity of headlines and articles: headlines are consistently less objective, and lean more towards an emotive tone (positive or negative).  The larger the difference in objectivity, the larger the difference in tonality between the headline and article.  This trend held across the entire data set, with some outliers appearing when the difference in objectivity was small enough as to be considered insignificant.  I also used a general mixture model to cluster the data, to confirm these same trends.  I also used this mixture model with rejection sampling to control for specific variables, showing that our trends held even when we set one of the variables to some constant. While there were limitations to what I could feasibly analyze and compute, the data and analysis in this paper suggests that, across all *New York Times* articles from 2003, the headlines were consistently and significantly less objective and exhibited more tone than the article itself.
